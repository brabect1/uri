Tcl URI Package
==============

`uri <https://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/doc/trunk/embedded/www/tcllib/files/modules/uri/uri.html>`_
is a Tcl package that implements Unified Resource Identifier (URI) scheme as per
`RFC 3986 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3986>`_.
Its official code is a part of the ``uri`` module in `Tcllib <https://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/>`_.

This is a forked version, which is to provide the ``uri`` package independent
of Tcllib. It is meant for cases where custom Tcl interpreters come without Tcllib,
which is quite frequent for EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools.
